# We are going to isolate the api controllers under a namespace,

# app/controllers named api, the name is important as it is the namespace
# weâ€™ll use for managing the controllers for the api endpoints

# Defining namespace under 'api', By defining a namespace under the routes.rb file. Rails will
# automatically map that namespace to a directory matching the name under the
# controllers folder, in our case the api/ directory.
